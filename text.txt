For G the website needs to be developed towards
a Firebase-database.
For VG the website needs a API and a database.

When the page loads all the tasks need to show.
When new tasks are added they will be put in
the To-Do tab until they will be assigned a 
person.
The tasks In Progress will need a Done button
when clicked the task will auto go to Done
list.
In the Done list all the tasks will have a
delete button which will delete the tasks.

Each task needs to have the color based 
on what topic it is part of. 

The database structure:

tasks
    firebase id
        task: {en string}
        category: {“ux” / “dev frontend” / “dev backend”}
        status: {“to do” / “in progress” / “done”}
        assigned: {en string}


if (data[task].task && data[task].category && data[task].status && data[task].assigned) {
            console.log("OK");
        }
        else {
            console.log('NOT OK')
            console.log(data[task]);
        }
        else if (data[task].assigned === "none" || data[task].assigned === undefined) {
            console.log("They ok");
            console.log(data[task]);
        }
        
        if (!'task' in data || !'category' in data || !'status' in data || !'assigned' in data) {
            console.log(data[task]);
            console.log("something broke");
        }
