For G the website needs to be developed towards
a Firebase-database.
For VG the website needs a API and a database.

When the page loads all the tasks need to show.
When new tasks are added they will be put in
the To-Do tab until they will be assigned a 
person.
The tasks In Progress will need a Done button
when clicked the task will auto go to Done
list.
In the Done list all the tasks will have a
delete button which will delete the tasks.

Each task needs to have the color based 
on what topic it is part of. 

The database structure:

tasks
    firebase id
        task: {en string}
        category: {“ux” / “dev frontend” / “dev backend”}
        status: {“to do” / “in progress” / “done”}
        assigned: {en string}


// import express from 'express';

// const app = express();
